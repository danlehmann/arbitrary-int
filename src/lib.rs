//! # arbitrary-int - Arbitrary number types for Rust
//!
//! This crate implements arbitrary numbers for Rust. Once included, you can use types like `u5` or `u120`.
//!
//! ## Why yet another arbitrary integer crate?
//!
//! There are quite a few similar crates to this one (the most famous being [ux](https://crates.io/crates/ux)). After trying out a
//! few of them I just realized that they are all very heavy: They create a ton of classes and take seconds to compile.
//!
//! This crate is designed to be very short, using const generics. Instead of introducing ~123 new structs, this crates only
//! introduces 5 (one for `u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64`, `u128`) and uses const generics for the specific bit depth.
//! It does introduce 123 new type aliases (`u1`, `u2`, etc.), but these don't stress the compiler nearly as much.
//!
//! Additionally, most of its functions are const, so that they can be used in const contexts.
//!
//! ## How to use
//!
//! Unlike primitive data types like `u32`, there is no intrinsic syntax (Rust does not allow that). An instance is created as
//! follows:
//!
//! ```rust
//! use arbitrary_int::u9;
//!
//! let value9 = u9::new(30);
//! ```
//!
//! This will create a value with 9 bits. If the value passed into `new()` doesn't fit, a panic! will be raised. This means
//! that a function that accepts a `u9` as an argument can be certain that its contents are never larger than an `u9`.
//!
//! Standard operators are all overloaded, so it is possible to perform calculations using this type. Note that addition
//! and subtraction (at least in debug mode) performs bounds check. If this is undesired, see chapter num-traits below.
//!
//! Internally, `u9` will hold its data in an `u16`. It is possible to get this value:
//!
//! ```rust
//! use arbitrary_int::u9;
//!
//! let value9 = u9::new(30).value();
//! ```
//!
//! ## Underlying data type
//!
//! This crate defines types `u1`, `u2`, .., `u126`, `u127` (skipping the normal `u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64`, `u128`). Each of those types holds
//! its actual data in the next larger data type (e.g. a `u14` internally has an `u16`, a `u120` internally has an `u128`). However,
//! `uXX` are just type aliases; it is also possible to use the actual underlying generic struct:
//!
//! ```rust
//! use arbitrary_int::UInt;
//!
//! let a = UInt::<u8, 5>::new(0b10101);
//! let b = UInt::<u32, 5>::new(0b10101);
//! ```
//!
//! In this example, `a` will have 5 bits and be represented by a `u8`. This is identical to `u5`. `b` however is represented by a
//! `u32`, so it is a different type from `u5`.
//!
//! ## Extract
//!
//! A common source for arbitrary integers is by extracting them from bitfields. For example, if data contained 32 bits and
//! we want to extract bits `4..=9`, we could perform the following:
//!
//! ```rust
//! use arbitrary_int::u6;
//!
//! let data = 5_u32;
//! let a = u6::new(((data >> 4) & 0b111111) as u8);
//! ```
//!
//! This is a pretty common operation, but it's easy to get it wrong: The number of 1s and `u6` have to match. Also, `new()`
//! will internally perform a bounds-check, which can panic. Thirdly, a type-cast is often needed.
//! To make this easier, various extract methods exist that handle shifting and masking, for example:
//!
//! ```rust
//! use arbitrary_int::{u6, u12};
//!
//! let data = 0b1010100000_u32;
//! let a = u6::extract_u32(data, 4);
//! assert_eq!(a.value(), 0b101010);
//! let data2 = (0x800 as u128) << 63;
//! let b = u12::extract_u128(data2, 63);
//! assert_eq!(b.value(), 0x800);
//! ```
//!
//! ## num-traits
//!
//! By default, arbitrary-int doesn't require any other traits. It has optional support for num-traits however. It
//! implements `WrappingAdd`, `WrappingSub`, which (unlike the regular addition and subtraction) don't perform bounds checks.
// By unconditionally declaring this crate as `no_std` we opt out of the standard library's prelude,
// which implicitly brings items like `Vec` and `String` into scope. Since we'd need to import those
// manually in case the `alloc` crate is used but the standard library isn't, we might as well keep
// things consistent and always manually import them.

    feature(const_convert, const_trait_impl, inline_const)
)]
#![cfg_attr(feature = "step_trait", feature(step_trait))]

// This makes it possible to use `std::` when the `std` feature is enabled, even though we're `no_std`.

// The `alloc` crate is always usable when the standard library (i.e. the `std` feature) is enabled.
// The standard library re-exports collections from the `alloc` crate, but since this crate supports
// `alloc` without `std` its best to use `alloc` directly: that works both with and without `std`.
