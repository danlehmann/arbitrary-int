# Changelog

## arbitrary-int 1.2.6

### Added

- Support `LowerHex`, `UpperHex`, `Octal`, `Binary` so that arbitrary-int can be printed via e.g. `format!("{:x}", u4::new(12))`
- Support `Hash` so that arbitrary-int can be used in hash tables

### Changed

- As support for `[const_trait]` has recently been removed from structs like `From<T>` in upstream Rust, opting-in to the `nightly` feature no longer enables this behavior as that would break the build. To continue using this feature with older compiler versions, use `const_convert_and_const_trait_impl` instead.

## arbitrary-int 1.2.5

### Added

- Types that can be expressed as full bytes (e.g. u24, u48) have the following new methods:
    * `swap_bytes()`
    * `to_le_bytes()`
    * `to_be_bytes()`
    * `to_ne_bytes()`
    * `to_be()`
    * `to_le()`

### Changed

- `#[inline]` is specified in more places

### Fixed
