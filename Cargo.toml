[features]
std = []

# Supports const trait implementation through const_convert and const_trait_impl. Support for those was removed
# from more recent Rust nightlies, so this feature requires an older Rust compiler
# (2023-04-20 is broken, 2022-11-23 works. The exact day is somewhere inbetween)
const_convert_and_const_trait_impl = []

# core::fmt::Step is currently unstable and is available on nightly behind a feature gate

# Supports defmt
defmt = ["dep:defmt"]

# Supports serde
serde = ["dep:serde"]
